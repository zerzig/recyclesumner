# recyclesumner
HTML/CSS/SCSS for recyclesumner.com

Recyclesumner.com has been setup with Wordpress for years. At this point, there is no need for Wordpress. Additionally I wanted to (re)learn HTML/CSS, etc.

File structre is based on 7-1 architecture using SASS. The grid is Skeleton since I only need a simple layout grid.
